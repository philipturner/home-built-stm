## Project Overview

Make a device that can image with atomic resolution. Place a layer of tripod nano-tips under the device, verify that they can also be imaged.

Attempt to perform atom-by-atom manufacturing. Not likely to succeed, but nonetheless ought to be attempted under ambient conditions.
- Subtractive, by etching individual atoms from the W tip.
- Additive, through thermodynamic cascade, with inverted tripod.

## Educational Value Added

PCB Design, Controls, Scanning Probe Microscopy, Computer Vision, Nanotechnology

Provides basic experience with the types of hardware necessary for manipulating individual atoms (e.g. IBM's [A Boy and His Atom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSCX78-8-q0)). This hardware typically costs an exorbitant amount of money, because it requires UHV and/or liquid helium conditions. I am testing how much functionality traditionally restricted to UHV can actually be achieved at ambient pressure.
