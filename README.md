## Project Overview

Vacuum-compatible STM with no nonlinearities in the relationship between piezo voltage and position.

## Progress (Jan 2025)

This project is officially a NANO 4994 research project for Spring 2025, worth 3 credits. After months of research, I found a potential solution to my main goal of building an STM, solving piezo creep. I discovered a new material that could make better piezoelectric actuators: <b>lithium niobate</b>. I am listing some of the calculations and scripts I have done. Currently, I am speed-running the tutorials for FreeCAD and KiCad.

- Ordered and received 10 lithium niobate piezo plates

I also read a few hundred pages of literature on:
- Nanopositioner design and control electronics
- Vibration isolation
- Ultra-high vacuum instrumentation and compatible technologies
- Ferroelectric materials (Landau Theory)
- A substantial portion of "Art of Electronics, 3rd Edition"

I have gotten through at least 50% of the tutorials I plan to take, for FreeCAD and KiCad.

## High-Level Overview

The current high-level plan is very rough. It will be split into different modules, which can be constructed once and recycled multiple times. I will conduct multiple experiments in sequence, some of which will reuse this equipment. For example, the very first capacitance measurement experiment can use the same vibration isolator as a late-stage STM iteration. It could even opt to only use the interior isolation stage.

Sequence of experiments:
- Measuring capacitance change between two parallel plates, to verify piezoelectricity of LiNbO3
  - Verify the predicted behavior, that it shears in both X and Y
- 1DOF scanning tunneling spectroscopy machine, that can maintain tunneling current without crashing the tip
  - Verify the measurement of 100 fA currents (100x more sensitive than the Mech Panda STM)
- 3DOF scanning tunneling microscope with limited range
  - Prove there is an absence of hysteresis and creep distorting the images of HOPG
  - Resolve individual atoms on Au(111), which Dan Berard could not do. Or find the reason it cannot be imaged under ambient conditions.
- Complete, end-goal iteration with 100 nm range X/Y/Z and vacuum compatibility
  - Remove the stepper motor Z coarse stage
  - Add slip-stick/stick-slip inertial drive for X and Z axes, clamped by gravity
  - X coarse stage enables "tripod assembly line", reducing a sample swapping bottleneck during atom building
  - Coarse stage uses shear piezos, but potentially out of the inferior PZT just to increase their range
  - PZT has piezo creep, but it has a similar effect to thermal drift with stepper motors. Wait until the coarse stage settles.
- Ultra-high vacuum system at room temperature
  - Prove that evaporation of lithium atoms from LiNbO3 is not a concern
  - Prove that evaporation of atoms from the conductive epoxy is not a concern
  - Prove that the system can withstand bakeout, if STM modules are typically required to undergo bakeout
  - Verify that the previously designed system can function (take an image) while producing a vapor pressure of under 10^-10 torr

System modules:
- UHV compatible spare pre-amplifiers
  - Each time a pre-amplifier is used, it might be soldered irreversibly to the STM tip
  - A custom design that minimizes parasitic capacitance, might need to be discarded with the broken tip
  - This is similar to qPlus sensors, which have some MEMS circuitry on whatever the tuning fork is glued to
  - Minimize the magnitude of thermal drift caused by the op-amp's ~7 mW power consumption
- Two-stage spring suspension system
  - Viton high-frequency dampers are incompatible with UHV. They're compatible with HV, but not UHV (Viton has a vapor pressure of 10^-8 or 10^-7 torr).
  - Use a single-stage, compact spring for the high-frequency part. This is small enough to fit inside a UHV chamber.
  - Use a single-stage low-frequency isolator with ~1.7 Hz vertical resonance frequency. Copying the "Open STM" design.
  - The low-frequency isolator models a pessimistic outcome, where you need an air table, and you can't utilize Minus K technology.
  - This table would hold the entire UHV chamber in the far-term prototype. Near-term, it serves to conveniently hold the electronics.
